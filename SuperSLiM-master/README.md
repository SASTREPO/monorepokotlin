## What is Version 5
Version 5 is the current development branch for SuperSLiM. Once Milestone 3 is reached it will become the main branch for the library. Currently available from this branch are the following things:

- an adapter implementation backed by a DAG
- a layout manager that can layout a hierarchy of nested sections
- a linear section layout
- predictive animations for item changes
- support for layout configurations; layout direction (LTR, RTL), reverse layout, stack from end, and horizontal and vertical layout configurations.
- an example app
- way too much work for what you see

What does it not yet have? **Lots**. See the [project plan](https://trello.com/b/g3Wctuey) for more details, and support me on [patreon](https://www.pateron.com/Tonic).
